Let $P(m, X, N)$ and $Q(m, X, N)$ be a $2m+1$-degree polynomials.
In this manuscript we present and discuss an efficient method of spline approximation
for power function such that $X^{2m+1}$ and $X^{2m}$
are approximated in some neighborhood $a \leq X \leq b$ having fixed $N$ and $m$.
The interval of convergence $a \leq X \leq b$ rises as $N$ raise, meaning that as $N$ increases
the absolute value $|a-b|$ increases as well.
%with percentage error of approximation $E$ less than $2\%$ for $X \geq 6$.
