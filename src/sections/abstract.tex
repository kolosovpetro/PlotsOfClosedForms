Let $P(m, X, N)$ and $Q(m, X, N)$ be $m$-degree polynomials in $X\in\mathbb{R}$
having fixed non-negative integer values for $m$ and $N$.
In this manuscript an efficient method of spline approximation for power function is shown and discussed.
Approximation technique is based on the fact that both $P(m, X, N)$ and $Q(m, X, N)$
approximate the polynomial $X^{2m+1}$ in for $a$ in some neighborhood of fixed $N$.
